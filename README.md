## Code of Conduct 
* This program reaches out to people of all ages, to anyone interested in dipping their toes into the world of programming and learning how to get involved in an open-source project. Because this platform will predominantly be used by those who are not experts in this area, and because there will be people involved of all ages and backgrounds, we ask that foul or derogatory language to not be used. Any offensive language is prohibited and will be removed if seen or reported. 
* In the case of any wrongdoings by a party, there is a potential risk of suspension and/or expulsion from involvement on this open-source project. We do not condone maltreatment of others nor plagiarizing and taking credit of another's work. The consequences of such actions will be determined by their severity. 
* This project is welcome to all, and we do not support bullying, hate, or belittlement of anyone on here. This is a place of community where those involved benevolently cooperate and work together. We are expected to support one another with all of our ideas and any criticism is expected to be constructive rather than destructive.
